4.9 PROGRAM 4 (part 3): Text message decoder (loops)
-----

<br>(1) Get a line of text from the user. Output that line. Then output the line again, this time expanding all of the found common text message abbreviations. You can do this by using a loop. Ex:

    Enter text: My BFF is David. IDK who your BFF is.
	You entered: My BFF is David. IDK who your BFF is.
	Expanded: My best friend forever is David. I don't know who your best friend forever is.

Support these abbreviations:

	BFF -- best friend forever
	IDK -- I don't know
	JK -- just kidding
	TMI -- too much information
	TTYL -- talk to you later
*Note: If an abbreviation appears more than once, every instance gets expanded.*
